The application allows you to carry, store and store measurement data in a self-control diary, analyze the current statistics of blood sugar measurements by creating graphs. The DiaPsy app will help you count the units of bread in your meals, save new foods to the database, which will probably help determine a young person with type 1 diabetes to be free when planning out-of-home snacks. The Psychology function allows you to read articles on the psychology of diabetes, to get an answer to your question from a clinical psychologist.
